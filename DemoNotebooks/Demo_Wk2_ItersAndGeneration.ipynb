    "## Iterators and Iterability\n",
    "You have surely had some exposure by now to Python's capacity for iteration through sequences (such as string, lists, etc.) and the ability for programmers to define new, customized classes. You may have not, however, been familiarized with the structures that enable you to make your own classes iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an object in Python to be iterable, it must satisfy the \"Iterator Protocol,\" which entails having two particular methods:\n",
    "- Object.\\_\\_iter\\_\\_( ), a function that returns an iterator\n",
    "- Object.\\_\\_next\\_\\_( ), a function that controls the iteration process, as well as its eventual termination \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's build our own iterable class called VowelCatcher. VowelCatcher will take in a string on initialization and, when iterated upon, will return \"T\" if the corresponding letter in the given string is a vowel, returning \"F\" otherwise. At the end of iteration, it will also print off the vowel count and a converted string of T/F."
